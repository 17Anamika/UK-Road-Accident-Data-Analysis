# UK-Road-Accident-Data-Analysis
End-to-end data analysis of UK road accident data using Python, SQL, and Power BI.

Absolutely — this sounds like a solid, end-to-end data analytics project, and your README should show that off clearly without being overwhelming. Below is a clean, professional, GitHub-ready README summary you can copy-paste and tweak.




🚦 UK Road Accident Data Analysis

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing UK road accident data to uncover patterns, trends, and risk factors contributing to road accidents. The analysis covers the entire data analytics pipeline — from raw data preprocessing to interactive dashboard creation — using Python, SQL, and Power BI.

The goal of this project is to derive actionable insights that can help understand accident severity, high-risk locations, and time-based trends.




🛠️ Tools & Technologies

1. Python – Data preprocessing & analysis

2. SQL – Advanced querying & aggregation

3. Power BI – Data modeling & visualization





📊 Project Workflow

1️⃣ Data Preprocessing (Python)

Performed extensive data preparation using Python, including:

1. Data encoding

2. Data cleaning (handling missing values & inconsistencies)

3. Data transformation

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

5. Feature engineering

6. Statistical analysis to identify meaningful relationships





2️⃣ Data Analysis (SQL)

Used SQL for deeper analysis on the processed dataset:

1. Aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT)

2. GROUP BY and ORDER BY

3. Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

4. Filtering and ranking accident data to identify critical patterns





3️⃣ Data Visualization & Reporting (Power BI)

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard with:

1. Power Query for data transformation

2. Dedicated Measures Table using DAX

3. Custom Date & Time tables built using DAX

4. Time intelligence functions:

   MTD (Month-to-Date)

   QTD (Quarter-to-Date)


5. Interactive slicers for:

   Date

   Time


6. Filter pane to display Top 5 accident-prone locations

7. Insight-driven visualizations for better decision-making





🔍 Key Insights

1. Identified high-risk accident locations across the UK

2. Analyzed accident trends based on time, date, and severity

3. Highlighted patterns that contribute to higher accident frequency

4. Enabled dynamic filtering to support exploratory analysis
