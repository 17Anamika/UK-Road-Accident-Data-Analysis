# UK-Road-Accident-Data-Analysis
End-to-end data analysis of UK road accident data using Python, SQL, and Power BI.




🚦 UK Road Accident Data Analysis

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing UK road accident data to uncover patterns, trends, and risk factors contributing to road accidents. The analysis covers the entire data analytics pipeline — from raw data preprocessing to interactive dashboard creation — using Python, SQL, and Power BI.

The goal of this project is to derive actionable insights that can help understand accident severity, high-risk locations, and time-based trends.




🛠️ Tools & Technologies

1. Python – Data preprocessing & analysis

2. SQL – Advanced querying & aggregation

3. Power BI – Data modeling & visualization





📊 Project Workflow

1️⃣ Data Preprocessing (Python)

Performed extensive data preparation using Python, including:

1. Data encoding

2. Data cleaning (handling missing values & inconsistencies)

3. Data transformation

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

5. Feature engineering

6. Statistical analysis to identify meaningful relationships



📌 *Clean Dataset*  
Due to file size constraints, the cleaned dataset used in this project is hosted externally.

2️⃣ Data Analysis (SQL)

Used SQL for deeper analysis on the processed dataset:

1. Aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT)

2. GROUP BY and ORDER BY

3. Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

4. Filtering and ranking accident data with high risks to identify critical patterns





3️⃣ Data Visualization & Reporting (Power BI)

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard with:

1. Power Query for data transformation

2. Dedicated Measures Table using DAX

3. Custom Date & Time tables built using DAX

4. Time intelligence functions:

   MTD (Month-to-Date)

   QTD (Quarter-to-Date)


5. Interactive slicers for:

   Date

   Time


6. Filter pane to display Top 5 accident-prone locations

7. Insight-driven visualizations for better decision-making





🔍 Key Insights
1. Afternoon and evening hours record the highest accident volumes, with peaks during summer and autumn.
2. Night-time accidents are fewer but more severe, showing a higher fatal or serious risk rate.
3. Clear weather and normal road conditions account for most accidents due to higher traffic exposure, while adverse conditions increase risk severity.
4. Urban areas dominate total accidents, whereas rural areas show relatively higher accident severity.
5. Single carriageways and non-junction roads experience the most accidents, especially in urban settings.
6. Uncontrolled pedestrian crossings are associated with higher accident counts than controlled crossings.
7. A small set of police forces and local authorities account for a large share of total accidents.
8. Police attended roughly two-thirds of accident scenes, with the remaining incidents unassisted.
9. Quarterly accident distribution is fairly stable, with Q1 slightly lower than other quarters.
10.Dual carriageways involve more vehicles per accident, reflecting higher traffic density.
